# Typing Game

You will see a random word on screen and need to type it. If you type the correct letter, hippo
will move one step forward. If not, it will remember the number of incorrect letters. Press equal number of backspaces to erase errors, and then move forward.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:80`](http://localhost:80) from your browser.

If you need port 4000, make sure you change the config file (config/dev.exs).
